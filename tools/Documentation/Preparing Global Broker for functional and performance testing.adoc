The documentation _Preparing Global Broker for functional and performance testing_ details how to prepare the Global Broker for the functional and the performance testing.
Some of the configurations can be done ahead of the effective day of the tests.

== Configuration of the WIS2 Nodes subscription

=== For the functional tests
Two WIS2 Nodes are deployed on EWC at EUMETSAT;
The DNS names of the two nodes will be:

- test10.wis2dev.io
- test11.wis2dev.io

The _centre_id_ for this WIS2 Nodes will be *io-wis2dev-10-test* and *io-wis2dev-11-test*

They will be used during the functional tests of the Global Broker.

=== For the performance tests

Two hundred WIS2 Nodes, only for WIS2 Notification Messages, will be deployed on 5 VMs. On each VMs, 40 WIS2 Nodes will be deployed. They will share the same MQTT Broker, however the _centre_id_ and the subscription topic will be different for each WIS2 Node.

The DNS name of the VM will be:
- test100.wis2dev.io (for centre_id from 100 to 139)
- test140.wis2dev.io (for centre_id from 140 to 179)
- test180.wis2dev.io (for centre_id from 180 to 219)
- test220.wis2dev.io (for centre_id from 220 to 259)
- test260.wis2dev.io (for centre_id from 260 to 299)

=== MQTT Configuration 

The MQTT broker(s) will be reachable using:

```
MQTT_SUB_BROKER=mqtt://test10.wis2dev.io (and also 11, 100, 140, 180, 220 and 260)
MQTT_SUB_USERNAME=everyone
MQTT_SUB_PASSWORD=onlyone
```

1. Default MQTT port will be used (1883)
2. The password is changed to _onlyone_. This allows to prevent the default authentication (everyone/everyone) to be usable, while keeping the authorization (typically using only the username) unchanged

=== Notification Message tests

As no metadata record will be provided, checking the existence of the metadata record by the Global Broker must be disabled.

As the topic used for the test messages will be correct, checking the validity of the Topic Hierarchy must be done.

As the Notification Messages will be syntactically correct, checking the compliance of the Notification Message with the defined schema (schemas.wmo.int) must be done.

=== centre_id and subscription

The centre_id will be of the from io-wis2dev-[number]-test with number varying from 10, 11 and 100 to 299. 100 to 139 on test100.wis2dev.io and so on.

Messages will be published on the topic `origin/a/wis2/io-wis2dev-x-test/#` (with x varying from 10, 11, 100 to 299).

==== Summary

Using the antiloop software used by Brazil and France, as an example, the configuration file _io-wis2dev-100-test.env_ will be : 

```
MQTT_SUB_BROKER=mqtt://test100.wis2dev.io
MQTT_SUB_USERNAME=everyone
MQTT_SUB_PASSWORD=onlyone
MQTT_SUB_TOPIC=origin/a/wis2/io-wis2dev-100-test/#
CENTRE_ID=io-wis2dev-100-test
MSG_CHECK_OPTION=verify
TOPIC_CHECK_OPTION=verify
METADATA_CHECK_OPTION=no
GDC_URL=https://api.weather.gc.ca/collections/wis2-discovery-metadata/items?lang=en&f=json&q=
SCHEMA_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golfvert/wis2-topic-hierarchy/main/wis2-notification-message.json
```

The configuration file _io-wis2dev-210-test.env_ will be : 

```
MQTT_SUB_BROKER=mqtt://test180.wis2dev.io
MQTT_SUB_USERNAME=everyone
MQTT_SUB_PASSWORD=onlyone
MQTT_SUB_TOPIC=origin/a/wis2/io-wis2dev-210-test/#
CENTRE_ID=io-wis2dev-210-test
MSG_CHECK_OPTION=verify
TOPIC_CHECK_OPTION=verify
METADATA_CHECK_OPTION=no
GDC_URL=https://api.weather.gc.ca/collections/wis2-discovery-metadata/items?lang=en&f=json&q=
SCHEMA_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golfvert/wis2-topic-hierarchy/main/wis2-notification-message.json
```

Ahead of the testing period, each Global Broker operator is invited to prepare the configuration for the 202 (2 + 200) WIS2 Nodes.

== Preparing the Global Broker for the tests

In order to run the tests, the operators of the Global Broker will need to:

1. Remove all the subscriptions to existing and _real_ WIS2 Nodes 
2. Modify the password of the _everyone_ user on the broker of the Global Broker from *everyone* to *onlyone*
3. Delete all existing subscriptions to broker of the Global Broker (Users, other Global Brokers, Global Caches have a subscription to the broker)
4. Enable all configurations to the _test_ 202 WIS2 nodes

Depending on the Global Broker and the MQTT broker used, the method of doing the four steps above will be different and is beyond the scope of this document. 

When those steps are completed, the Global Broker will be ready to run the functional and performance tests.

== Putting back the Global Broker for WIS2 operations

After the performance tests, the operators of the Global Broker will need to:

1. Remove all the subscriptions to _test_ WIS2 Nodes 
2. Modify the password of the _everyone_ user on the broker of the Global Broker from *onlyone* to *everyone*
3. Delete all existing subscriptions to broker of the Global Broker 
4. Enable all configurations to the _real_ WIS2 nodes

Depending on the Global Broker and the MQTT broker used, the method of doing the four steps above will be different and is beyond the scope of this document. 

When those steps are completed, the Global Broker will be back to normal operations.
